<h3>Disappearing Text Writing App</h3>
<p>100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp assignment<p>
<br>
In this code:<br>
The <b>WritingApp</b> class creates a simple tkinter window with a text widget.<br>
The <b>on_key_pressed</b>b> method is called whenever a key is pressed. It cancels the existing timer and starts a new one.<br>
The <b>start_timer</b> method sets a timer for 5 seconds to clear the text.<br>
The <b>clear_text</b> method deletes all text in the text widget.<br>
<br>
When you stop typing for 5 seconds, the text in the widget will disappear ðŸ‘€
